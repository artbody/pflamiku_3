# pflamiku 3
is a automatic watering system for indoor plants
this here is the C Implementation of the functions needed by the hardware with an STM32L031

# Its main features are:

* **FSM based user interface and workflow**: clearly and unambiguously defined behaviour.
* **Minimal Memory Requirements**:  footprint of 20 kBytes.
* **STM32L031**  a very low power microcontroller.

TODO 
Reimplementing the FSM with 
# Web-Based Modeling Tool and Code Generator
The FW Profile Editor is available as a web-based tool to help design FW Profile state machines and procedures and to automate the generation of the C-code which configures them. The tool can be accessed from [here](http://pnp-software.com/fwprofile/editor/).
